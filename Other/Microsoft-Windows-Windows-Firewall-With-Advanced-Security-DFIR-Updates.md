## Interesting Changes

While it seems all events are new (at least their ID). A lot of them have are describing the same behavior based on their messages as some older events. Here are a couple of example:

- Both `EID 2052` and `EID 2006` have the same event message. The new addition that `EID 2052` brings is a new field called `ErrorCode` and that's pretty much it, nothing else was added from a field perspective.

- If we take `EID 2071` and `EID 2004`. Similar to the previous example, the only field added was `ErrorCode`.

So what's the catch? Why create events that looks practically the same but with different IDs?

First of all this not uncommon of event ids at all in ETW. Events are generated for specific activities and sometimes new ones are added with small tweaks for compatibility, consistency or any other reason.

## What's the catch

In this case though and at least what to the extent of what I tested. It seems like the older events such as `2004` and `2006` no longer trigger on Windows 11 but instead we're getting their new replacements that I mentioned above.

This is important because if you're doing DFIR or building detection around this Provider/EventLog you might think there were no events (as I did at first)

> Fun fact. Both EID 2093 and 2094 seem to have a typo in the their event message. Specifically the word "occured" is misspelt ^^
